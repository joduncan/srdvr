srdvr
=====
A simple (-ish) Ruby dvr example.

It does not do any actual recording. It should illustrate my code organization
and decision making skills.

to run the scheduler:
---------------------
open the CSV file, supply timestamps and durations that would execute soon.
run the dvr.rb script

to lookup a scheduled recording:
--------------------------------
run the lookup.rb script with the timestamp that you wish to observe.
